# Mockfish

A minimax chess engine

https://replit.com/@42AH/Mockfish-A-minimax-chess-engine

Mockfish is a low-level chess AI, powered by the minimax algorithm, using alpha-beta pruning.

Currently depth can only be set up to three, without extreme wait time (unless you use PyPy.)

Minmax is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case scenario.
This engine calculates every possible combination of moves up to a certain depth, and assignes each ending a score. The higher the score (or lower, if it is the minimizer,) the better the move.

Help!

1) Why does depth 2 beat depth 3?
2) Why does depth 2 pretty much only use horses?
3) Why do depth 1 & 3 favor moving pawns?
4) How can I improve this in any way? (Besides getting a GUI, I am working on it)

Thanks for any feedback
