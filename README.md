A minimax chess engine

https://replit.com/@42AH/Mockfish-A-minimax-chess-engine

Mockfish is a low-level chess AI, powered by the minimax algorithm, using alpha-beta pruning.

Currently depth can only be set up to three or four, without extreme wait time (unless you use PyPy.)

Minmax is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case scenario.
This engine calculates every possible combination of moves up to a certain depth, and assignes each ending a score. The higher the score (or lower, if it is the minimizer,) the better the move.

If you know why the winning bot will go into a draw (specifically five-fold repitition,) please help.

Thanks for any feedback
