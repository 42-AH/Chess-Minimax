.SH DESCRIPTION
Mockfish is a low-level chess AI, powered by the minimax algorithm, using alpha-beta pruning, created by 42-AH.

Currently depth can only be set up to three or four, without extreme wait time (unless you use PyPy.)

Minmax is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case scenario.
This engine calculates every possible combination of moves up to a certain depth, and assignes each ending a score. The higher the score (or lower, if it is the minimizer,) the better the move.
